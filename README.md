So far I've gotten Puppeteer working and able to grab a webpage with fighter information. Next steps are to gather all the different info from each page and then build a database of fighter info that we can then query instead of just using web scraping to get the data.

1. Get list of UFC roster
2. pass each fighter's name into a function that scrapes Sherdog.com or UFC.com for the info
3. Store the data in a JSON file
4. Use JSON database to populate front-end

GOAL: Make an app that's actually USEFUL when watching fights and wanting fighter or matchup info.
